# Project 4 - Design & Plan

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are acceptable.


# Planning

## Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?

Shimtah is the one and only Korean Traditional Percussion group of Cornell University and in the Ithaca area, working as the cultural ambassador to preserve and spread the spirit of Korean culture. Shimtah would like a informative website used to introduce the club, inform people about Korean traditional music, and recruit new members.


> NOTE: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the Project 4 requirements.


## Site's Purpose (Milestone 1)
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.

The site has a few purposes. To start, it will explain Korean percussion and its history to users who do not know what it is. The site will also be a portal for interacting with the club, including links to social media, contact forms, and upcoming performance schedules. It will also host content that the club creates, such as videos and photos from performances.

<!-- - Have a contact form used for recruiting future members
- Inform people about Korean traditional music and instruments
- Inform people about the club's history and current members
- Have a photo & video gallery of past performances
- Inform people about upcoming performances -->

## Client Meeting Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from the client meeting, an email they sent you, or whatever you used to keep track of what was discussed at the meeting.

  ![](meetingnotes2.jpg)

## Client Needs and Wants (Milestone 1)
> Collect your client's needs and wants for the website. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Memo** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.

Needs/Wants: [Brief Title]
- **Need/Want**
  - A place to show photos and videos
- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - 2 pages, one for photos and one for videos
  - Display 8-12 photos on the page in a grid format
  - For videos, take thumbnails from youtube videos, display them as links to the videos themselves
- **Memo**
  - Because there aren't that many photos, we have more space on the screen to display them, so they can be bigger/higher quality. They also don't need to be organized in any way (chronological, etc.), so we can put them in a grid format
  - Having links to youtube videos via thumbnails circumvents needing to embed the videos, while still providing users a photographic preview of the video they'll be seeing, which would be lost in a text link.

- **Need/Want**
  - A description of Shimtah, Korean percussion, and its history
- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - An "instruments" page that shows off all of the instruments used in Korean percussion, with pictures.
  - An "about" page that describes the history of the club, as well as brief introductions from club members
- **Memo**
  - Because all of the instruments in Korean percussion are unique, it makes sense to have a whole page dedicated to explaining them.
  - The information about the instruments should be separate from the information about the club, so users can find relevant information more quickly, hence the separate about page.

- **Need/Want**
  - A way to learn about and contact the club
- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - The aforementioned "about" page that will have the history of the club, as well as member bios.
  - A contact form at the bottom of this page, where users will be prompted for name, email, and year.
  - Logos at the footer of each page for instagram, youtube, and facebook, that link to Shimtah's respective page on each of those platforms. The club's email will also be in the footer.
- **Memo**
  - Having bios of current members makes the club more personable, which prospective members would want
  - A contact form is the best way to reach out to prospective members. We will put it on the same page as the rest of the information about the club because it is club-logistics-related, as opposed to Korean-percussion-related.
  - Having logos at the footer will make Shimtah's additional pages accessible from anywhere on the site.

> Tell us about the users (target audience) for this website.

Mainly Korean & Korean American students at Cornell University or any student who is interested in Korean culture or percussion music group. A smaller, but relevant audience is friends and family of club members who want to find performance videos and other content.

  ## Discovering Users' Needs (Milestone 1)
  > You'll need to discover your users' needs. Talk to them! Document what you've learned about them. When talking to your users, take notes and include those notes here.


## Users' Needs (Milestone 1)
> Analyze the users' needs and wants from your notes above. List each need/want below. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.
> **Note:** These are probably *not* the needs of your client.

  **Need/Want**
   - A way to contact the club for those interested in signing up.
 - **Design Ideas and Choices**
   - Social media logos at the footer on each page
   - An about page with club history, members, and a contact form
 - **Memo**
   - As mentioned in the client needs section, one of the primary uses of this site is outreach for new members, so links to social media and contact forms are important.

   **Need/Want**
    - Information on what the club is
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - The instruments page with descriptions of the four instruments used.
    - Photos and videos pages for users to check out.
    - An upcoming performance schedule on the main page
  - **Memo**
    - Videos of performances and descriptions of instruments will give the users all they need to know about what the club does.
    - They can also get an idea of the club's performance schedule by looking at the main page.

    **Need/Want**
     - Friends/family of club members looking for club performance content
   - **Design Ideas and Choices**
     - The photo and video pages, as listed above.
     - Performance schedule on the main page.
   - **Memo**
     - The photos and video pages, as well as showing prospective members what Shimtah does, also provides a way for friends and family to see club members performing.
     - Similarly, the performance schedule can both inform new members what the performance schedule is like as well as tell friends and family when performances will occur so they can attend.


## User Testing Plan (Milestone 1)
> Plan out your tasks for evaluating whether your site will meet the needs of the users. These must be actual user testing tasks. Tasks are not questions!

1. Get on the club's mailing list

2. Find out which Shimtah instruments would be interesting to you

3. Find a video of current club members playing that instrument

4. See if you know anyone already in the club


## Content (Milestone 1)
> Plan out your site's content (text, images, etc.). Make a list of **all** the content you will need. This list should be **exhaustive**.

We will have five pages for the website: Index, About, Instruments, Photo, Video

- Index Page: Welcome message, Club logo, information about upcoming performance
  - Upcoming performance: Shimtah's 20th Anniversary and the 19th Annual Concert.
  - Date: 2020 / 2 / 8 (Saturday, TBD), Willard Straight Hall, 5PM ~ 7PM (TBD), Free tickets, Dinner provided

- About Page: Introduction to the Club & Contact form
  - Club Photo with a club description.
  ![](club2019.jpg)
  - "Welcome to Shimtah! Shimtah was established in 1999 as the one and only Korean Traditional Percussion group at Cornell University and the Ithaca area, working as the cultural ambassador to preserve and spread the spirit of Korean culture.

- Instruments Page: Introduction to the history of Korean percussion music and instruments Shimtah plays
  - Pungmul (Korean: 풍물; ) is a Korean folk music tradition that includes drumming, dancing, and singing. Most performances are outside, with dozens of players all in constant motion. Pungmul is rooted in the dure (collective labor) farming culture. It was originally played as part of farm work, on rural holidays, at other village community-building events, and to accompany shamanistic rituals, mask dance dramas, and other types of performance.
  - A group of four men led by Kim Duk-soo and Kim Yong-bae, both descendants of namsadang troupe members, performed an impromptu arrangement of Pyeongtaek (utdari) pungmul with each of its four core instruments. Unlike traditional pungmul, this performance was conducted in a seated position facing the audience and demonstrated a variety of rhythms with great flexibility.
  - Shimtah bases its roots in Imsil Pilbong Pungmul, performing Pangut, Seonban Seoljanggu, Bukchum, Yeongnam Samul, and Cornell Samul.
  - These are four core instruments played in Pungmul.

https://omeka1.grinnell.edu/MusicalInstruments/items/show/352
- ![](kkwaenggwari.jpg)
- The Kkwaneggwari, often noted as "swe", is a small flat gong producing distinctively high-pitched, metallic tone that breaks into a cymbal-like crashing timbre when struck forcefully. Swe is typically the lead instrument in pungmul, and the lead swe of the group serves as the musical lead of the group.

http://www.soundofasia.com/jikotrgo.html
- ![](jing.jpg)
- The Jing is a large gong made of brass and is struck by a stick that is layered with cloth at one end to soften the texture of the sound produced. It is capable of producing a gentle and lingering sound as well as a big sound with a roaring effect, depending on force applied when striking against the brass.

http://www.soundofasia.com/bukkobadr151.html
- ![](buk.jpg)
- The Buk is a traditional Korean drum. While the term buk is a native Korean word used as a generic term meaning "drum", it is most often used to refer to a shallow barrel-shaped drum, with a round wooden body that is covered on both ends with animal skin
https://www.lapercussionrentals.com/instruments/janggu/591
- ![](janggu.jpg)
- The Janggu is the most representative drum in Korean percussion music. It is available in most kinds, and consists of an hourglass-shaped body with two heads made from animal skin. The two heads produce sounds of different pitch and timbre, which when played together are believed to represent the harmony of man and woman.

## Interactivity Ideas (Milestone 1)
> Come up with some idea for interactive features for your site.

- Contact form with conditional validations
- Interactive photo / video gallery
- Dynamically changing countdown clock based on context

# Design & Evaluation

## Design Process (Milestone 1)
> Document your design process. Show us your card sorting. Design your navigation from the card sorting. Outline your navigation. Describe your theme. Show us sketches of your site (mobile and desktop versions). etc.
> You should show us how your came up with your design and how your iterated on that design; show us the evolution of your design.

> **Note:** Card sorting is used to organize your site's content. For each piece of content identified in the previous section, write a summary of that content onto a card. Now sort the cards. The grouping of cards provides you with your pages for your website. **Do not write down the pages you want and then "card sort" those. That is not card sorting.**

Theme: We want the website to be inviting to new members/interested students. The website's theme is meant to reflect the traditional Korean style the club is based around, with pictures of the instruments as a background image in the home page, as well as the club logo in the top left of every page. We need the website to look organized and contain recent content in order to make the club look active and interesting.

The club already had a basic template for the website that didn't have any content that they wanted us to use, with minor changes wherever necessary. This included the logo on every page and the background image on the home page. We thought the template was good, but we decided that the navigation bar at the top of the page should have a black background instead of white, to contrast the navigation with the actual content of the page, which had a white background.

In our initial design, we wanted the home page to have the "welcome to Shimtah" message, and the upcoming performance schedule further down the page. Then, at the bottom, we would have the contact form for the club.

We then conducted a card sort with one of the club members. This card sort reflected their thought process when they were designing the template for the website initially:

![](cardSort.JPG)

After this, we decided that the contact form should go on the "about" page, because that page contained everything else related to club logistics. The sorter also thought there should be some sort of introduction to the club that was more than just "Welcome to Shimtah" on the front page. We decided to add "Traditional Korean Drumming Club" as well under the "welcome to Shimtah", as well as a brief club introduction, to clarify to users what the club does. Our final sketch for the home page looked like this:

![](home-sketch1.jpg)

For the about page, we decided to have a brief history of the club at the top of the page, followed by eboard bios, followed by a contact form. Here was the sketch:

![](about-sketch1.jpg)

At first, we had all of the photos aligned, descending down the page. The only change we wanted to make to this sketch was to make the order of the photos and bios alternate, so the bio is on the left and the picture is on the right for every other member. We think that this will make the page more visually appealing, and more exciting. We didn't make a whole other sketch for it, given that it was just a minor change. We decided to do the same thing to the instruments page, which is reflected in our sketch for that page:

![](instruments-sketch1.jpg)

The photos page was pretty simple, we decided on a grid view and didn't see any reason to change. We think the same layout will work for the videos page, but we'll need to do some user testing with the coded draft in milestone two to make sure.

We want to do testing with this design to make sure it works well. Until we do that, our mobile site will look similar. We removed the grid view of the photos and videos page, instead displaying one per line to fit the smaller screen. The layouts for the other pages translate well to a small screen.


## Interactivity (Milestone 1)
> What interactive features will your site have? Describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.

- We would implement an interactive photo gallery. One of the main goals of the website is to archive pictures from past performances. Audiences of this website would be able to see large size pictures when they hover their mouse over the pictures.

![](meetingnotes3.jpg)

- Met with the e-board members to discuss our future plan and showed them our design journey
- Received feedback via email later
- Fixing interactivity content accordingly
- No specific changes or design demands yet - contact them again once we have a semi-polished website with content published so they can give us feedback regarding the content

## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Write your interactivity pseudocode here.

Example:
```
when DOM is loaded:
  if user is on photo gallery page:
    if mouse hovers over picture n:
